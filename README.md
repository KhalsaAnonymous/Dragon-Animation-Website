# Dragon-Animation-Website
This code is an SVG image of a Dragon, containing two groups: "Cabeza" (head) and "Aletas" (fins). The "Cabeza" group has two paths, one for the white part of the dragon's head and another for the black part. The "Aletas" group has a single path for the entire shape of the fins, which uses a linear gradient to fill it with a gray-to-black color transition.
